## Summary

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| READY | 7 |
| PARTIAL | 7 |
| BLOCKED | 5 |

> **Items 18–21 updated 2026-07-10** by Bring-Up Program: Embedded Runtime Reality Check.  
> Previously-claimed "READY" items for physical adapter factory and real ONNX inference have been  
> reclassified to BLOCKED — they were architecture stubs, not connected implementations.  
> The bring-up program adds real infrastructure (adapter factory, ONNX provider, Linux drivers, tests)  
> and honest documentation replacing prior overclaims.

---

### 3. OCR
**Status: PARTIAL**

- `ocrEngine.ts` (Tesseract.js + NullProvider), `textReadingEngine.ts` (domain-aware) implemented and tested.
- `reportOCRResult()` callback wired into session pipeline.
- OCR text routes through `formatOCRAnnouncement` → `buildOCRAlert` → coordination queue.

---

### 7. Offline Safety
**Status: READY**

- Network events (`window` online/offline) subscribed in `useVisionSession.ts`.

- Announcement deduplication: each state change announced exactly once.
- `failureRecoveryEngine.ts` monitors 12 failure scenarios per frame.
- 152 offline engine tests + 143 street safety tests passing.
- Local safety (Guardian + audio) remains fully active when offline.

---

### 8. Provider Fallback
**Status: READY**

- Automatic provider switching wired in `useVisionSession.ts` `runFrame`.
- Online → offline: immediately switch to simulation, announce, track reason.
- Weak connection: immediately switch to simulation, announce.
- Online restored: run cloud health check, restore only on success.
- Provider health tracked: `activeProvider`, `lastSwitchReason`, `lastSuccessfulInferenceAt`, `lastProviderError`, `fallbackLevel`.
- Critical alerts never wait for cloud recovery.
- 10 behavioral integration tests in `tests/networkProviderSwitching.test.ts`.

---

- Navigation ticks wired into `useVisionSession.ts` per frame.
- Guidance routes through `buildNavigationAlert` → coordination queue.
- 151 navigation engine tests passing.
- **Missing:** Live map integration. Navigation uses simulated routes and GPS fuzzing only.
- **Missing:** Real-world route accuracy not validated.

---

### 10. Haptics
**Status: PARTIAL**

- `hapticWearableEngine.ts` — 8-pattern library (critical, high, waypoint, etc.) implemented.
- Haptic patterns triggered in `speakCoordinated()` for critical and high-priority alerts.
- `navigator.vibrate` used for browser/phone prototype.
- **Blocked:** Physical glasses haptic actuator not connected to HAL.

- `locationPrivacyEngine.ts` — GPS fuzzing (0.01° grid), storage consent.
- 69 sensor fusion tests passing.
- **Missing:** Physical IMU on glasses (not browser DeviceMotion).
- **Missing:** GPS accuracy in indoor environments is poor.

---

### 12. Physical HAL Adapters
**Status: BLOCKED**

- `hardwareBridgeEngine.ts` — I/O routing, disconnect safety, safety rules — implemented.
- `wearableConnectionEngine.ts` — device registry, heartbeat — implemented.
- `deviceCapabilityEngine.ts` — browser API detection, setup instructions — implemented.
- 97 hardware bridge tests passing.
- **New (bring-up):** `src/runtime/adapters/createHardwareAdapterSet.ts` — real adapter factory with `EmbeddedSimulationFallbackError` safety assertion. embedded-prototype mode never silently falls back to simulation-test.
- **New (bring-up):** `src/runtime/adapters/hardwareAdapterTypes.ts` — `CameraFrame` gains `pixels: Uint8Array | null`, `pixelFormat`, `stride` fields.
- **New (bring-up):** 9 Linux driver boundary files: `v4l2CameraDriver`, `alsaMicrophoneDriver`, `audioPlaybackDriver`, `gpioButtonDriver`, `hapticDriver`, `imuDriver`, `batteryDriver`, `thermalDriver`, `gnssDriver`, `networkDriver` — all in `src/runtime/drivers/linux/`. Document real Linux kernel calls; report errors honestly; never fabricate readings.
- **Blocked:** No physical hardware connected. Drivers report 'failed' or 'unavailable' on non-Linux hosts.
- **Blocked:** Native bindings (v4l2-camera, node-alsa, spi-device) not yet installed on target board.
- **Note:** Thermal and network drivers CAN be tested on any Linux device via `/sys/class/thermal/` and `/sys/class/net/`.

---

### 18. Hardware Adapter Factory + Safety Assertion
**Status: BLOCKED**

- `src/runtime/adapters/createHardwareAdapterSet.ts` — factory with `EmbeddedSimulationFallbackError` safety assertion.
- `src/runtime/inference/onnxLocalInferenceProvider.ts` — real ONNX inference provider using dynamic import of `onnxruntime-node`; `MockOnnxInferenceProvider` for tests (labeled `isSimulated: true`).
- `src/runtime/inference/createLocalInferenceProvider.ts` — factory + `assertNoSimulatedDetectionsInEmbeddedMode` guard.
- `src/types/hardwareValidation.ts` — `HardwareValidationRecord` schema for physical bring-up sign-off.
- `src/runtime/startPrototypeRuntime.ts` — bug fixed: now uses `createHardwareAdapterSet()` (was hardcoded to `assembleSimulationAdapters(true)` regardless of mode).
- Integration tests: `tests/embeddedRuntime.integration.test.ts` — 26+ assertions covering factory, safety guards, ONNX status, driver environment checks. No physical device required.
- Hardware-only tests: `tests/hardwareOnDevice.test.ts` — skipped unless `DENARIXX_RUN_PHYSICAL_HARDWARE_TESTS=true`. Blocked until physical prototype exists.
- **Blocked:** `onnxruntime-node` requires native compilation on target board; ONNX provider will report `runtime-unavailable` until installed.
- **Blocked:** Real camera frames (`pixels !== null`) require V4L2 driver integration with native binding.
- **Blocked:** No physical hardware tested.

---

### 19. Local ONNX Inference (Real Model)
**Status: BLOCKED**

- Architecture complete: `OnnxLocalInferenceProvider` handles preprocessing (bilinear resize → normalize → NCHW), YOLOv8 output decoding, NMS.
- Graceful failure: all error paths return empty detections + explicit error message — never fabricated detections.
- Safety invariant: `EmbeddedSimulatedDetectionError` thrown if mock detections reach Guardian in embedded-prototype mode.
- **Blocked:** No ONNX hazard detection model exists yet. COCO-SSD (80 generic classes) is a placeholder; a domain-specific model tuned for pedestrian hazards, stairs, vehicles, and kerbs is required.
- **Blocked:** `onnxruntime-node` not yet installed on compute module.
- **Blocked:** No real camera frames (V4L2 pixels) to run inference on.

---

### 13. Firmware Bridge

- Architecture documented in `docs/HARDWARE_PROTOTYPE_SPEC.md`.
- **Blocked:** No actual firmware communication protocol implemented.
- **Blocked:** No physical compute module to bridge to.

---

### 14. Wearable Battery / Thermal Integration
**Status: PARTIAL**

- `powerManagementEngine.ts` — battery/thermal classification, voltage curve, drain simulation — implemented.
- Browser Battery API integrated via `useDeviceSensors.ts`.
- Battery-aware frame rate scaling active in `runFrame`.
- Battery-critical failure monitored via `detectActiveFailures`.
- **Missing:** Physical battery and thermal sensors not connected.
- **Missing:** Values are browser Battery API or simulated — not from glasses hardware.

---

### 15. Real-User Validation
**Status: BLOCKED**

- Pilot testing infrastructure: `pilotTestingEngine.ts` + `/pilot` page — 7 scenarios, consent, feedback, report.
- Field trial infrastructure: `fieldTrialEngine.ts` + `/field-trials` page — 9 scenarios, safety metrics, incident reports.
- Safety validation metrics: 8-metric scoring system in `safetyValidationEngine.ts`.
- **Blocked:** No sighted or visually impaired users have tested the system.
