## Item-by-Item Assessment

### 1. Camera Pipeline
**Status: PARTIAL**

- Browser `getUserMedia` works; live frames are captured in simulation and local-ai modes.
- `glassesCameraEngine.ts` HAL is architecture-complete with 4-camera model.
- `cameraPipelineEngine.ts` FPS throttle, battery mode, and frame skip logic all tested.
- **Missing:** Physical glasses cameras not connected. HAL is a stub. No real camera hardware verified.
- **Blocker:** Physical prototype hardware.

---

### 2. Guardian (Hazard Detection + Alert Quality)
**Status: READY**

- `cognitiveGuardianEngine.ts`, `alertQualityEngine.ts`, `alertDeduplicationEngine.ts`, `guardianWordingEngine.ts`, `guardianDecisionLogger.ts` all implemented and wired.
- 60 Sprint 5 tests + 37 V2 tests + 96 E2E tests passing.
- Connected in `useVisionSession.ts` via `alertQualityEngineRef`.
- Directional wording, confidence hedging, cross-frame dedup — all active.
- Crossing language rule confirmed: never "safe to cross".

---

### 3. OCR
**Status: PARTIAL**

- `ocrEngine.ts` (Tesseract.js + NullProvider), `textReadingEngine.ts` (domain-aware) implemented and tested.
- `reportOCRResult()` callback wired into session pipeline.
- OCR text routes through `formatOCRAnnouncement` → `buildOCRAlert` → coordination queue.
- **Missing:** Tesseract.js model loads in-browser (~15 MB). Not loaded until user enables OCR mode.
- **Missing:** Real sign / label / medicine recognition not validated with physical users.

---

### 4. Speech Output (TTS)
**Status: READY**

- Web Speech API TTS active via `useAudioGuidance`.
- All speech routes through `speakCoordinated()` → 7-level priority queue.
- Priority mapping: critical_hazard → critical, high_navigation → high, etc.
- Emergency interrupt (stops lower-priority speech) confirmed in 96 E2E tests.
- `textToSpeechEngine.ts` provider abstraction implemented.
- **Caveat:** Bone-conduction hardware not connected. Browser speaker used in prototype.

---

### 5. Speech Input (STT)
**Status: PARTIAL**

- `speechRecognitionEngine.ts` implemented with Web Speech API and wake word detection ("Hey Aria").
- `useVoiceCommands.ts` wired to session page.
- `voiceInteractionEngine.ts` orchestrates STT + TTS + emergency mode.
- **Missing:** Not available in all browsers (no Firefox/Safari without flag).
- **Missing:** Performance on glasses compute module not validated.

---

### 6. Alert Coordination
**Status: READY**

- `alertCoordinationEngine.ts` — 7-level priority queue: `critical_hazard` → `system_failure` → `high_navigation` → `important_ocr` → `normal_navigation` → `scene_description` → `companion_info`.
- Deduplication by key + cooldown, critical interrupt logic — all active.
- All audio sources (vision, OCR, navigation, companion, system, network) route through single queue.
- 96 E2E tests confirm multi-source ordering and interrupt behavior.

---

### 7. Offline Safety
**Status: READY**

- Network events (`window` online/offline) subscribed in `useVisionSession.ts`.
- `networkMonitorEngine.ts` and `connectivityFallbackEngine.ts` fully integrated.
- Announcement deduplication: each state change announced exactly once.
- `failureRecoveryEngine.ts` monitors 12 failure scenarios per frame.
- 152 offline engine tests + 143 street safety tests passing.
- Local safety (Guardian + audio) remains fully active when offline.

---

### 8. Provider Fallback
**Status: READY**

- Automatic provider switching wired in `useVisionSession.ts` `runFrame`.
- Online → offline: immediately switch to simulation, announce, track reason.
- Weak connection: immediately switch to simulation, announce.
- Online restored: run cloud health check, restore only on success.
- Provider health tracked: `activeProvider`, `lastSwitchReason`, `lastSuccessfulInferenceAt`, `lastProviderError`, `fallbackLevel`.
- Critical alerts never wait for cloud recovery.
- 10 behavioral integration tests in `tests/networkProviderSwitching.test.ts`.

---

### 9. Navigation
**Status: PARTIAL**

- `navigationIntelligenceEngine.ts` (indoor/outdoor, landmarks, crossing decisions) implemented.
- Navigation ticks wired into `useVisionSession.ts` per frame.
- Guidance routes through `buildNavigationAlert` → coordination queue.
- 151 navigation engine tests passing.
- **Missing:** Live map integration. Navigation uses simulated routes and GPS fuzzing only.
- **Missing:** Real-world route accuracy not validated.
- Crossing guidance uses safe language: "appears clear, but please check carefully."

---

### 10. Haptics
**Status: PARTIAL**

- `hapticWearableEngine.ts` — 8-pattern library (critical, high, waypoint, etc.) implemented.
- Haptic patterns triggered in `speakCoordinated()` for critical and high-priority alerts.

---

### 13. Firmware Bridge
